# Bird-bodymass-2023
This repository contains a collection of scripts that investigate how body mass variety in birds structures the modular evolutionary organisation of the avian skeleton, and the strength of its ecological adaptation to flight style variety.

The script 'Compile_datasets_22_10_2022_clean.R' will draw upon supplied or cited source files to generate and save datasets for analysis in subsequent scripts.
